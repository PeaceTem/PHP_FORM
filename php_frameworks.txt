Laravel and Symfony

There are numerous PHP frameworks available for web development, but two 
widely-used frameworks are Laravel and Symfony.

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework that was introduced in 2011. It
 provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools and features such as routing,
  ORM, MVC architecture, template engine, authentication, and more. Laravel is
   well-known for its clear and concise syntax, and it is designed to help developers
    create efficient and scalable web applications quickly.

Similarly, Symfony is another widely-used, free, open-source PHP web framework that
 has been available since 2005. It is a complete framework that includes many
  built-in functionalities and adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
   Symfony is extremely versatile and modular, allowing developers to select the
    specific components they need for their projects. Furthermore, Symfony has a large
     and active community, which implies that there are plenty of resources and
      third-party packages available to assist developers in getting started.
